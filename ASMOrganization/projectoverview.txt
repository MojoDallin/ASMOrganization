If you're reading this, I assume you're a programmer like I am.
So anyways, here's an overview:

Homepage -> Logistics Manager
			-> Import Transfer Board -> Lets you import a board from an Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx) file for the next transfer.
			-> Generate Logistics -> Generates an Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx) file containing which missionaries are in the same area, in the same zone, moving zones, and new missionaries.
			-> Change File Path -> Allows you to set the destination of said Excel spreadsheet file.
		 -> Housing Data
			-> New House -> Add a new house to the housing data.
						 -> Takes a name, ID, X coordinate, Y coordinate, missionary names, and teaching areas.
			-> Search -> Lets you search for a house based on name, missionaries, ID, or zone.
			-> House Buttons -> View information about each house.
		-> Configuration -> Lets you change a lot of things pertaining to the logic of logistics.

You should know how to compile, but unless you dont:
(this assumes you are using Visual Studio)
At the top of the screen, there should be two dropdown menus with text Debug and Any CPU.
Change Debug to Release, and build. Easy. Be sure to change back to Debug once done.
The .exe should be located at: C:\Users\ChurchSupport\Documents\ASMOrganization\ASMOrganization\bin\Release

Feel free to change the code around. It is saved to GitHub so unless you're overwriting it (WHICH YOU SHOULDNT BE), you're safe to play with it.
