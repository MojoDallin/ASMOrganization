If you're reading this, I assume you're a programmer like I am.
So anyways, here's an overview:

Homepage -> Current Transfer Board -> Lets you view the board for the transfer currently in progress.
			-> Import Transfer Board -> Lets you copy a transfer board from a text file.
		 -> Next Transfer Board -> Allows you to move people around for transfers.
			-> Update Transfer Board -> Lets you copy the new board to the old board.
		 -> Generate Logistics -> Generates a text file containing all the logistics for transfer day.

You should know how to compile, but unless you dont:
(this assumes you are using Visual Studio)
At the top of the screen, there should be two dropdown menus with text Debug and Any CPU.
Change Debug to Release, and build. Easy. Be sure to change back to Debug once done.
The .exe should be located at: C:\Users\ChurchSupport\Documents\ASMOrganization\ASMOrganization\bin\Release

Feel free to change the code around. It is saved to GitHub so unless you're overwriting it (WHICH YOU SHOULDNT BE), you're safe to play with it.

Any questions, shoot me a message on messenger or an email at dallin.schmidt@missionary.org.
