If you're reading this, I assume you're a programmer like I am.
So anyways, here's an overview:

Homepage -> Logistics Manager
			-> Import Transfer Board -> Lets you import a board from an Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx) file for the next transfer.
			-> Generate Logistics -> Generates an Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx) file containing which missionaries are in the same area, in the same zone, moving zones, and new missionaries.
			-> Change File Path -> Allows you to set the destination of said Excel spreadsheet file.
		 -> Housing Data
			-> New House -> Add a new house to the housing data.
						 -> Takes a name, ID, X coordinate, Y coordinate, missionary names, and teaching areas.
			-> Search -> Lets you search for a house based on name, missionaries, ID, or zone.
			-> House Buttons -> View information about each house.
		-> Configuration -> Lets you change a lot of things pertaining to the logic of logistics.

You should know how to compile, but unless you dont:
Open a new terminal (View -> Terminal), and then type in:
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release /p:PublishSingleFile=true /p:IncludeAllContentForSelfExtract=true
This will compile the program into a single executable. It will then be found at:
C:\Users\ChurchSupport\Documents\ASMOrganization\ASMOrganization\bin\Release\net8.0-windows\win-x64\publish

Feel free to change the code around. It is saved to GitHub so unless you're overwriting it (WHICH YOU SHOULDNT BE), you're safe to play with it.
